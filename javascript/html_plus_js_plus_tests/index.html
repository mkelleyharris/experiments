  <h1>Demo HTML + JS + Unit Tests</h1>
  <p>HTML and unit tests both try to use same code.js.</p>
  <p> Old approach tried to bring in code.js via script tag as text/javascript, and used Document.write. Result: If the code.js exports js functions/class, it works in test, but not html. Without exports, it works in html but not in tests. What's the solution to work in both HTML and tests?</p>
  <p> Newer approach uses import within script tags in index.html and Window.divid.innerHTML.  Now works in both tests and html. (Requires web server locally, not just file open. e.g. python3 -m http.server 9000) See text added dynamically below.

  <div id="contact_info">(contact TBD)</div>
  <div id="copyright_date">(copyright date TBD)</div>

  <script type=module>
    import {getContact, OtherInfo} from './code.js';

    window.contact_info.innerHTML = "Contact: " + " " + getContact() + '<br>';

    window.copyright_date.innerHTML = "Copyright: " + " " + OtherInfo.getCopyrightDate();

  </script>
